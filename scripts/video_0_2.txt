 Zooming in panning are ways to navigate around an image that you use often is he work on images in Photoshop to practice working with zoom and pan controls open this image from the tutorial practice files or open a large image of your own zooming means changing the magnification of the image it might do if you were looking at the sky through a telescope you may wanna zoom in for a closer view of part of an image or you may wanna see him out to see more of an image on your screen the most straightforward way to zoo. Is to select the zoom to up at the bottom of the tools panel here then go up to the options bar for the zoom tool where you'll find a plus icon for zooming in and A minus icon for zooming out let's start with the plus icon activated which is the default then to zoom in moving to the image and click and each time you click you zoom in a little further to zoom back out to see more of the image again go back to the options bar and this time select the Mina saiko? And then click several times in the image to zoom back out if you want to zoom in again you have to go back to the options bar click the plus icon and click on the image to zoom in again thank you make it tired of going up to the options bar every time you wanna switch between zooming in and zooming out so here's a shortcut that will help you when the zoom in option is active as it is now you can switch to zooming out by holding the option key on your keyboard if you're on a Mac or the alt key. Windows hold down the key and then click on the image and that will automatically switch you back to zooming out then released your finger from the option eroski and your switch back to zooming in and so you can click in the image to zoom in again the zoom tool has a couple of options in its options bar that you can use to move quickly to zoom levels that you use often the fit screen option here in the options bar comes in handy when you. Zoomed in like this and you wanna get back to a few of the entire image just click the fit screen option and the entire image fix itself into your document window another useful option is this 100% option clicking this soon as you enter 100% view of the image which is the best way to view an image when your checking out for sure plus now I'm working on a small screen and this image is pretty large so when I zoom into 100% I can't see the whole image on my. Although you may not experience the same thing if you're working in a large monitor so if I wanna see a different part of this image at this zoom level I'm going to need to move the image around in my document window that's called panic and it's done with another tool the hands to help so I'm going to go back to the tools panel and I'm going to select the hand tool there which is just above the zoom till then I'm moving to the image and notice that my cursor is now changed to a hand I can't I'll click. Drag and move the image in the document window to a place that I want to see and then I release my mouse when I'm done checking the sharpest here and I wanna go back to view the entire image on screen I'll go up to the options are for the hand tool and they are all see the same fit screen option that we had for this room 12 so I can just click fit screen in the hand tool options bar and that takes me back to see the entire image in my document window let me show you enough. The way to zoom instead of clicking you can do continue assume by holding your mouse down on the image I'll go back and get the zoom tool in the 12 panel and then I'm going to click and hold in the image in the image zooms in continuously if you zoom in really far like this you can see the pixels that are the building blocks of an image in photo shop by the way the size of these pixelskin affect the image quality of a print which is why it. Resolution is an important topic especially for printing something will talk more about when we cover resizing an image later in the series I'm going to go up to the options bar and click fit screen so I can see the entire image on my screen again one more thing let's say that you're working with another 12 maybe the brush tool and your painting in a small area and you don't want to switch out of the brush tool over to the zoom tool just to zoom well there's a shortcut that you can use instead of the zoom tool. That is to hold the command key on a Mac or the control key on a PC as you press the plus key on your keyboard and every time you do that that wasn't meant if you want to zoom back out hold the command key on a Mac or the control key on a PC and press the minus key on your keyboard and that wasn't me back out so that's an introduction to zooming in panning that I hope will help you to navigate your images as you working on them in photo shop to finish up with.
