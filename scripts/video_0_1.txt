 Let's take a look at how photo shop is laid out to help you get comfortable with your workspace to follow along with this tutorial you can open any image the first interface element to get familiar with is the document window which is right here in the center of the screen this is where you work on your images over to the right of the document window are the panels that have a variety of image editing controls there are more panels than just those you see in the spinal column some of the panels are hidden behind others for example. Can we have a panel group of the color panel and swatches panel if I wanna see this watch is panel I can just click it stab and that brings it forward so I can use it I'll go ahead and select a blue swatch here in this watch is panel and that color will be applied when I use other color features like the brush tool there is some panels that are open on the face of photo shop to open one of those panels go up to the window menu and choose from this list of alphabetical panels panel that doesn't have a check? For example I choose the histogram panel that opens the histogram panel and after I'm done using it to evaluate that owns in a photograph for example I can close it by clicking the double pointed arrow hear another important interface element is the tools panel which is located to the left of the document window is this long vertical bar here if you're not sure what that will as you can just hover over its icon and in a moment you'll see the name of the tool in a 12 step. Select it will just click it there more tools than you see in the face of the tools panel you can click and hold any tool like the horizontal type to hear that has a little triangle at the bottom right corner and just see if I out menu of related to us so if I want to add text not in a horizontal orientation but rather in a vertical orientation I can just slide down to the vertical type to let this fly out menu and select it from there each tool has a number of control. Options and those are found in the next major interface element horizontal options bar up here at the top of the screen the important thing about the options bar is the changes depending on what tool is selected so because I have the vertical type to a selected I see options for text like this font size menu here but keep your eye on the options barazai select another 12 I'll click on the brush tool for example and now the options have changed to offer brush opacity and brush floanne. Work let's go ahead and apply an option one of the things you often want to do when you have a brushless selected is to change the size of the brush tip and you can do that using the brush pick her option which is the first option over here on the left of the options park I'll click that option to open the brush picker and then I can move the size slider in the brush picker over to the right to increase the size of the brush tip or to the left to decrease it and then I'll click in a blank area to close the brush picker I'll move. Into the image and I'll apply some paint and by the way the brush tool is painting with blue because you remember that's the color I chose in this watch is panel earlier in this video by the way if I change my mind about that paint stroke or whatever I just didn't foto shop I can undo it by pressing the common keyboard shortcut for undo which is command plus Z on a Mac or control plus C on a PC. Or at the very top of the screen and here you have multiple men used with lots of controls for example if I wanna close this image I can select clothes from the file menu and you can go ahead and close the image without saving since we haven't made any permanent changes so that was a quick look at the major features of the photo shop in her face that you use over and over as you working photo shop the document window the panels the tools that will options and the menu bar.
